# DNS Switch
DNS Switcher is a software tool that allows users to change their DNS server settings easily. DNS stands for Domain Name System, and it is responsible for translating human-friendly domain names (such as google.com) into the IP addresses that computers use to connect to websites.

When you enter a website URL into your web browser, your computer sends a DNS query to find the IP address associated with that domain name. By default, your computer will use the DNS server provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to resolve queries. However, sometimes these default DNS servers may be slow or unreliable.

That's where DNS Switcher comes into play. It allows you to switch to a different DNS server that may be faster or more dependable. This can result in faster web browsing and a better overall online experience. 

DNS Switcher works by modifying the DNS server settings of your operating system. It may also allow you to create different profiles with different DNS server settings for different situations. For instance, you could create a profile for use with a VPN that has its own DNS servers. 

In short, DNS Switcher is a useful tool for those who want to improve their internet experience by switching DNS servers.
